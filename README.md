# Islandora Vagrant [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora-Labs/islandora_vagrant.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora-Labs/islandora_vagrant)

## Introduction

The is a development environment virtual machine for Islandora 7.x-1.x. It should work on any operating system that supports VirtualBox and Vagrant.

N.B. This virtual machine **should not** be used in production.


## Requirements

1. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
  * Be sure to install a version of VirtualBox that [is compatible with Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/virtualbox/)
2. [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com)
  * Important: be sure to install Vagrant version 2.0.3 or higher
  * If upgrading from a previous version run ```bash vagrant plugin update``` to avoid plugin issues
3. [git](https://git-scm.com/)

Note that virtualization must be enabled in the host machine's BIOS settings.

## Variables

### System Resources

By default the virtual machine that is built uses 3GB of RAM. Your host machine will need to be able to support that. You can override the CPU and RAM allocation by creating `ISLANDORA_VAGRANT_CPUS` and `ISLANDORA_VAGRANT_MEMORY` environment variables and setting the values. For example, on an Ubuntu host you could add to `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export ISLANDORA_VAGRANT_CPUS=4
export ISLANDORA_VAGRANT_MEMORY=4096
```
The files involved will also exceed 10GB. Your host machine will need at least that much free storage.

### Hostname and Port Forwarding

If you use a DNS or host file management plugin with Vagrant,  you may want to set a specific hostname for the virtual machine and disable port forwarding. You can do that with the `ISLANDORA_VAGRANT_HOSTNAME` and `ISLANDORA_VAGRANT_FORWARD` variables. For example:

```bash
export ISLANDORA_VAGRANT_HOSTNAME="islandora.vagrant.test"
export ISLANDORA_VAGRANT_FORWARD="FALSE"
```

## Use

1. `git clone https://github.com/islandora-labs/islandora_vagrant`
