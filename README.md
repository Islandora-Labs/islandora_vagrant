# Islandora Vagrant [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora-Labs/islandora_vagrant.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora-Labs/islandora_vagrant)

## Introduction

The is a development environment virtual machine for Islandora 7.x-1.x. It should work on any operating system that supports VirtualBox and Vagrant.

N.B. This virtual machine **should not** be used in production.


## Requirements

1. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
2. [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)


## Variables

### System Resources

By default the virtual machine that is built uses 3GB of RAM. Your host machine will need to be able to support that. You can override the CPU and RAM allocation by creating `ISLANDORA_VAGRANT_CPUS` and `ISLANDORA_VAGRANT_MEMORY` environment variables and setting the values. For example, on an Ubuntu host you could add to `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export ISLANDORA_VAGRANT_CPUS=4
export ISLANDORA_VAGRANT_MEMORY=4096
```

### Hostname and Port Forwarding

If you use a DNS or host file management plugin with Vagrant,  you may want to set a specific hostname for the virtual machine and disable port forwarding. You can do that with the `ISLANDORA_VAGRANT_HOSTNAME` and `ISLANDORA_VAGRANT_FORWARD` variables. For example:

```bash
export ISLANDORA_VAGRANT_HOSTNAME="islandora.vagrant.test"
export ISLANDORA_VAGRANT_FORWARD="FALSE"
```




## Use

1. `git clone https://github.com/islandora-labs/islandora_vagrant`
2. `cd islandora_vagrant`
3. `vagrant up`

## Connect

You can connect to the machine via the browser at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

The default Drupal login details are:
  - username: admin
  - password: islandora

MySQL:
  - username: root
  - password: islandora

Tomcat Manager:
  - username: islandora
  - password: islandora

Fedora:
  - username: fedoraAdmin
  - password: fedoraAdmin

GSearch:
  - username: fgsAdmin
  - password: fgsAdmin

ssh, scp, rsync:
  - username: vagrant
  - password: vagrant
  - Examples
    - `ssh -p 2222 vagrant@localhost` or  `vagrant ssh`
    - `scp -P 2222 somefile.txt vagrant@localhost:/destination/path`
    - `rsync --rsh='ssh -p2222' -av somedir vagrant@localhost:/tmp`

## Environment

- Ubuntu 14.04
- Drupal 7.37
- MySQL 5.5.41
- Apache 2.26
- Tomcat 7.0.52
- Solr 4.2.0
- Fedora 3.8.1
- GSearch HEAD
- Islandora 7.x
- PHP 5.5.9 
- Java 8 (Oracle)

## Customization

If you'd like to add your own customization script (to install additional modules, call other scripts, etc.), you can create a `custom.sh` file in the project's `scripts` directory. When that file is present, Vagrant will run it after all the other provisioning scripts have been run.
